### Initial Plan

The plan was give some animation in section when scrolling, using CSS **transform: skew()** and **transform : rotate()** when stacking 2 images and give alpha animation and maybe experiment with horizontal scrolling. Using background .png containing transparent color to give some illusion of depth.
